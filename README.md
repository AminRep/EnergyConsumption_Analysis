# EnergyConsumption_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting energy consumption in the steel industry, a sector known for its high energy demands. Exploring the dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the **Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost)**, was used to develop a predictive model for energy usage. The analysis explores daily and hourly consumption patterns, power efficiency, and the environmental impact of load types on CO2 emissions. The resulting model achieved a high precision, with an **RÂ² of 0.9996**, demonstrating robust predictive capability. Key findings highlight distinct energy usage trends and the influence of operational factors, providing valuable insights for optimizing energy management and enhancing sustainability in the steel industry.
